  But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth
  iniquity, <span class="add">and</span> doeth according to all the abominations
  that the wicked <span class="add">man</span> doeth, shall he live? All his
  righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that
  he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he
  die.</p>
