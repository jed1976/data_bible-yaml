  And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus
  saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, Because the Syrians have said, The
  <span class="nd">LORD</span> <span class="add">is</span> God of the hills, but
  he <span class="add">is</span> not God of the valleys, therefore will I
  deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I
  <span class="add">am</span> the <span class="nd">LORD</span>. </p>
